<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This is my own personal chicken soup recipe I make at home all the time. 
    Since it's getting to be that season again I thought I'd share it!
</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 large yellow onions</li>
    <li>1 carrot</li>
    <li>2-3 celery stalks</li>
    <li>About 1 piund boneless chicken breast</li>
    <li>About one pound bone in thighs</li>
    <li>2-3 potatoes</li>
    <li>Pot pie noodles</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cut the onions,carrots and celery into equal parts.</li>
    <li>get them going on a low heat to sweat, avoid browning your mire poix.</li>
    <li>when the mire poix is ready, about 20-30 minutes later, start filling the pot with water and get the thighs in.</li>
    <li>let the broth cook for a few hours and when it's done strain the liquid into a seperate container</li>
    <li>you can save the thigh meat and add that and the broth back to the pot</li>
    <li>cut the potatoes and breast meat and add to the broth</li>
    <li>add the pot pie noodles last and when they're soft it's done!</li>
</ol>
